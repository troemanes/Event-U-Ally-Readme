    <h1>Event-U-Ally - Technologies & Features</h1>

  <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
  <ol>
       <li><strong>Kotlin</strong>
            <p> Kotlin is the primary programming language for Android development, chosen for its modern features, concise syntax, null safety, and full compatibility with Android’s ecosystem. It ensures maintainable and robust code, crucial for scalability.</p>
        </li>
        
  <li><strong>UI with XML</strong>
            <p> XML is used for layout and UI structure in the app. It helps define reusable and adaptable views, which make the app's user interface flexible and easily manageable across multiple device sizes and orientations.</p>
        </li>

   <li><strong>Firebase Firestore for Database</strong>
            <p> Firestore is used for storing dynamic, real-time data. It handles user profiles, events, and related content seamlessly, ensuring users can instantly access and update data across multiple devices while maintaining synchronization.</p>
        </li>

   <li><strong>Google Maps for Event Location Search</strong>
            <p> Google Maps enables users to search and discover event locations easily. By providing accurate geolocation and mapping features, users can effortlessly find events in their vicinity or plan future activities in different locations.</p>
        </li>

  <li><strong>Firebase Phone Authentication</strong>
            <p> Firebase Phone Authentication provides a secure and seamless login experience for users by verifying their phone numbers, ensuring their privacy, and reducing the need for traditional username/password combinations.</p>
        </li>
  
  <li><strong>AdMob for Monetization</strong>
            <p> AdMob allows the integration of ads within the app, offering various formats such as banner, interstitial, and rewarded video ads. This helps to generate revenue while keeping the app free for users.</p>
        </li>
        
  <li><strong>In-App Purchase Utilities</strong>
            <p> In-App Purchases (IAP) enable users to purchase premium features or content directly within the app. This provides a way to monetize certain features, enhancing user experience with additional customization or exclusive access.</p>
        </li>

  <li><strong>Room Database for Local Storage</strong>
            <p> Room is used to store local data, including user preferences, chat history, and other essential details that do not require real-time syncing. It provides offline support, which is crucial for the app’s performance and user experience.</p>
        </li>

   <li><strong>MVVM Architecture</strong>
            <p> The MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture is adopted to separate concerns and enhance the maintainability of the app. This pattern makes the codebase cleaner, testable, and scalable, allowing independent testing of the UI and business logic.</p>
        </li>

   <li><strong>Singleton Pattern</strong>
            <p> The Singleton pattern ensures that certain classes (such as network managers or app configuration) have a single, global instance throughout the app. This avoids redundant object creation, optimizing resource management and consistency.</p>
        </li>

  <li><strong>Coroutine Flow</strong>
            <p> Kotlin Coroutines, along with Flow, are used for handling asynchronous tasks, such as fetching data or performing background operations. They enable efficient, non-blocking I/O and provide an easy-to-use API for managing concurrency.</p>
        </li>

  <li><strong>Location and Other Permissions</strong>
            <p> The app uses location services to allow users to search and attend events based on their location. It also manages permissions for accessing the camera, storage, and other features, ensuring the app functions smoothly and securely on all devices.</p>
        </li>

   <li><strong>Chat and Profile Search</strong>
            <p> The chat feature allows users to communicate before events, facilitating social interactions. Profile search functionality enables users to discover and connect with others based on shared interests or event participation, fostering a sense of community.</p>
        </li>

  <li><strong>Push Notifications (App and Chat)</strong>
            <p> Push notifications keep users informed about event updates, messages, and reminders, ensuring they stay engaged with the app. Notifications are delivered for both in-app interactions and chat messages, enhancing communication and user retention.</p>
        </li>

  <li><strong>Glide for Image Loading</strong>
           <p> Glide is used for efficient image loading, caching, and displaying in the app. It helps load images asynchronously from the network or local storage while optimizing memory usage and ensuring smooth scrolling and performance in image-heavy sections of the app.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
