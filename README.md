   <h1><strong>Before Start</strong></h1>
    "Eventually" is my first and biggest project. I started coding to turn this idea into reality. I worked on it for over two years, building everything from the ground up. During this time, I learned so much. Unfortunately, while I was learning and developing, Google updated its Firebase tools and other services. As a beginner, I couldn’t find solutions to these changes because they were so new, and there weren’t any resources or tutorials available online or on YouTube.
    
   I faced many challenges, even with simple features like phone authentication and integrating maps, as the methods and guides kept changing. These unexpected issues caused big delays in my project. But in the end, I finished it.
    
   When I tried to publish the app on the Play Store, I faced even more problems. Being a solo developer, I didn’t have anyone to guide or support me, which made everything harder. On top of that, most of my friends were using iPhones, so I couldn’t ask them for help with testing. I had to find people in my city and on social media to help me. Despite all these difficulties, I managed to overcome them and "eventually" published the app on the Play Store.
    
   But my excitement didn’t last long. Just one or two weeks after publishing (while I was still improving the app and fixing bugs), I got a message from Google saying my developer account was terminated due to "high-risk behavior." I was shocked. I didn’t understand why this had happened. I searched everywhere for answers but found nothing. When I appealed to Google, they only pointed me to policy sections 8.3 and 10.3 without explaining what I did wrong.
    
  This broke my heart. I had quit my job as a civil engineer to focus fully on this project because I believed in it with all my heart. I had spent two years learning to code and working on this app, only to see it all disappear in an instant.
  
  Today, I’m working on new projects, but I still dream of fixing this app one day with a team or some investment. My goal is to rebuild the UI, learn everything about Play Store policies, and publish it again. By the time I do this, there will be many similar apps—apps that didn’t exist back in 2018 when I first had this idea. Even though the market is now full of competition, I still have unique ideas to make the app better and more fun.
    
   I won’t give up. One day, I will bring "Eventually" back to life, stronger and better than ever.

  <h1><strong>Highlights of Eventually</strong></h1>

  <h2>1. Group-Oriented Events</h2>
  <p>
    Eventually is designed to encourage group activities rather than one-on-one private dates. By focusing on events with a minimum of 3 participants, the app promotes a friendly, inclusive environment where people can enjoy activities as a team. Our goal is to help users build a community and friendships, not just connections.
  </p>
  <p>
    To maintain this group spirit, we’ve set a participant limit of 3 to 15 people for most events, ensuring a healthy and manageable group size. For premium users or company-organized events, this limit can be increased to accommodate larger gatherings.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Age Range Restrictions</h2>
  <p>
    Participants can only select an age range that includes their own age. This ensures a secure and comfortable environment where users engage with others in a relatable and compatible age group. By doing this, we prioritize trust and a sense of belonging in every event.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Gender Preferences</h2>
  <p>
    With gender preferences, users have full control over who joins their events. Whether it’s hosting a pajama party with just the girls, organizing a soccer match with the guys, or creating an open event for everyone, the choice is entirely yours. This flexibility empowers users to design events that suit their needs and interests.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Chat Timing</h2>
  <p>
    Chats for events open only 6 hours before the event starts. This feature is designed to keep the conversation focused on planning and coordinating the event—things like confirming attendance, deciding on meeting points, or sharing quick updates. The goal is to encourage participants to socialize in person rather than online, promoting real-world connections.
  </p>

  <p>
    Eventually combines these features to create a unique social experience, helping users form genuine friendships and enjoy shared activities in a safe, enjoyable, and inclusive environment.
